/**
 * Represents a [ProjectId] for maven projects composed by [groupId]:[artifactId].
 *
 * `packaging` and `classifier` is neglected on purpose. For instance, having a tests jar is seen as an additional
 * artifact during a release. We assume that such an artifact is never released alone but always together with all other
 * artifacts (otherwise it would have been released under a different artifactId and not just distinguished in its
 * classifier). Thus they do not identify the project but rather one of its artifacts. Open an issue if you require it.
 *
 * Have a look at [Apache's Documentation](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates) for further information.
 *
 * @param groupId The `groupId` of the maven project.
 * @param artifactId The `artifactId` of the maven project.
