# Dependent Graph Releaser
Dependent Graph Releaser is a tool which helps you with releasing a project and its dependent projects.
Its aim is to simplify the process of using up-to-date internal dependencies.
 
A simple example: having project `A -> B -> C` we want to automate the following process:
- release C
- update the dependency in B
- release B
- update the dependency in A
- release A

It will start of with supporting only maven projects and requires Jenkins integration.

You can also merely use it to get an HTML which represents a pipeline showing you, 
how you would need to release the projects manually. 
It generates kind of a bottom up dependency graph, or in other words a dependents graph. 

# Local usage

## Analyse

Add the projects you want to analyse to the folder `repos` (in the project directory) and run the following gradle command:
````
gr html -Pg=your.group.id -Pa=the.artifact.id
````
This creates a `pipeline.html` in the folder `rootFolder/build/html`. 

Notice, the task is clever and does not regenerate the html if nothing has changed in the code 
(the gradle task is mainly there to ease development, 
using `repos` as input of the task takes too much time depending on the number of projects you have).
Thus, if you add another project to the `repos` folder and want to rerun the task, then call `cleanJson` first. 

You can use `gr server` to start a lightweight local server serving `pipeline.html`. 
This is necessary since the `pipeline.html` wants to include a javascript file and your browser forbids that to protect you from XSS attacks.  

## Release

Not (yet) supported.

# Jenkins

## Set Up
The following guide shows how you can integrate dep-graph-releaser with Jenkins.

1. Get the latest resources at [bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/loewenfels/oss/ch/loewenfels/dep-graph-releaser-runner/)
   1. click on the latest version (or chose the one you want to use)
   2. download the ...-resources.jar
   3. extract it and delete the folder META-INF
2. Connect to your jenkins master (e.g., via ssh)
   1. change to the directory JENKINS_HOME/userContent (typically `cd /home/jenkins/userContent`)
   2. `mkdir dep-graph-releaser`
3. Copy the extracted resources to JENKINS_HOME/userContent/dep-graph-releaser
   1. Visit http(s)://JENKINS_URL/userContent/dep-graph-releaser/pipeline.html
   2. Most probably you will only see `Loading...` and nothing happens. That is due 
      [security measurements](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy), see next step
4. If Loading failed in the previous step (which is the default behaviour) 
   then you need to modify the following system property: `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP`
   1. Open up the Jenkins Script Console and run: 
      ```groovy
      System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "sandbox allow-scripts; script-src 'self'");
      ```
      This will allow that scripts of the same domain (same protocol and port) can be executed.
   2. The `Loading...` should now disappear (force reload if it does not, could also be caching)
   3. Modify the JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS in the Jenkins config (typically at `/etc/sysconfig/jenkins`) and add the system property.
      For instance, you could modify it as follows:
      ```
      # Original before modification for dep-graph-releaser
      # JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -server -Xmx2g"
      #
      # Modified version to allow dep-graph-releaser to execute its javascripts
      JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -server -Xmx2g -Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP=sandbox allow-scripts; script-src 'self'"
      ```
5. Create a job which runs the Main with command json
    - an example will follow using maven. 
      In short, you can use the [jenkins.pom](https://github.com/loewenfels/dep-graph-releaser/tree/v0.1.6/dep-graph-releaser-runner/src/jenkins.pom)
      if you use mvn (to retrieve dependencies).
    - if you want to run Main directly then you can use the [zip](https://dl.bintray.com/loewenfels/oss/ch/loewenfels/dep-graph-releaser-runner/) (chose version and then *.zip)
      containing all necessary libraries as well as a `.bat`

## Release

Explanation will follow
   
# Design Decisions   
- In case a dependency has specified `${project.version}` as `<version>` then it will be replaced with the new version.
   
# Known Limitations

The project does currently not support (pull requests are more than welcome):
- version managed in a property which itself refers to a property: `<properties><a>${b}</a><b>1.0.0</b></properties>`.
- version which is partly static and partly a property: `<version>1.0.0-${BUILD_NUMBER}</version>`.
- dependencies only defined in profiles (not yet tested, might be that it already works).
- simple regex replacement is used to update dependencies: if you have files containing malformed xml in comments, then updating dependencies might be erroneous.
